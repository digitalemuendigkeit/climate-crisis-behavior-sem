where a Cronbach’s alpha \\(\\geq\\) 0.7 could not be attained, we chose the item with the highest item-total correlation or, in case of Internal and External Control Conviction, one of the items based on content.\r\nCorrelation analysis of continous variables\r\nAs becomes apparent from the descriptive statistics, response data is not normally distributed.\r\nTherefore, we use Spearman’s rank correlation.\r\nCorrelation of all Climate Crisis model variables, different Knowledge measures and Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis correlation table contains all variables corresponding to constructs in the model, albeit differently specified (see Descriptive Statistics table).\r\nFurther, Knowledge is specified differently: Instead of a pseudo-continuous scale with 1 corresponding to an incorrect answer, 2 to a ‘don’t know’ and 3 to an correct answer, there are counts of how often a respondent answered correctly, incorrectly, or ‘don’t know’.\r\nThere is also a Subjective Knowledge variable which is a self-assessment of the amount of a respondent’s climate crisis related knowledge.\r\nMost of the correlations mirror relationships are already expressed in the model.\r\nAdditionally, there are the following correlations (\\(\\rho > 0.3\\)) which all are significant at the p < 0.001 level:\r\nBehavior is strongly correlated with Behavioral Intention, moderately correlated with Perceived Self-Efficacy, Perceived Response Efficacy and Personal Moral Norm, and weakly correlated with Perceived Susceptibility, Perceived Severity, Descriptive Norm, and Injunctive Norm.\r\nIt is also weakly and negatively correlated with all dimensions of Distrusting Beliefs in Science.\r\nBehavioral Intention is strongly correlated with Perceived Self-Efficacy and Perceived Response Efficacy, moderately correlated with Perceived Susceptibility, Perceived Severity, and Personal Moral Norm, and weakly correlated with Perceived Response Costs, Descriptive Norm, Injunctive Norm, and Subjective Knowledge.\r\nIt is also weakly and negatively correlated with all dimensions of Distrusting Beliefs in Science.\r\nAll Response Beliefs lower-order constructs are intercorrelated, with the correlation between Perceived Self-Efficacy and Perceived Response Efficacy being strong, and those with Perceived Response Costs being weak.\r\nPerceived Self-Efficacy and Perceived Response Efficacy are (at a minimum) moderately correlated with Perceived Susceptibility, Perceived Severity, Personal Moral Norm, and Descriptive Norm.\r\nThe relationship between Perceived Response Efficacy and Personal Moral Norm is strong, and Perceived Response Efficacy is weakly correlated with Subjective Knowledge.\r\nBoth Perceived Self-Efficacy and Perceived Response Efficacy are weakly and negatively correlated with all Distrust Beliefs variables.\r\nPerceived Response Costs is weakly correlated with Personal Moral Norm.\r\nPerceived Susceptibility and Perceived Severity are strongly intercorrelated.\r\nPerceived Susceptibility is moderately correlated with Personal Moral Norm, and negatively and moderately correlated with the Distrusting Beliefs variables.\r\nIt is weakly correlated with Injunctive Norm and Descriptive Norm.\r\nPerceived Severity on the other hand is strongly correlated with Personal Moral Norm, moderately positively correlated with Descriptive Norm, moderately negatively correlated with the Distrusting Beliefs variables, and weakly correlated with Injunctive Norm and the number of correct answers to Knowledge questions.\r\nAll normative variables are moderately intercorrelated.\r\nAdditionally, Personal Moral Norm is moderately and negatively correlated with the Distrusting Beliefs variables, and weakly correlated with Subjective Knowledge.\r\nDescriptive Norm is weakly and negative correlated with all Distrusting Beliefs dimensions.\r\nAll Distrusting Beliefs variables are strongly intercorrelated.\r\nSubjective Knowledge is weakly positively correlated with the number of correct answers, and negatively correlated with the number of questions respondents did not know an answer to.\r\nCorrelation of behavior and behavioral intention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe correlation between Diet, Driving, and General Behavior and Behavioral Intention is strong.\r\nIt is weak for Heating Behavior and Behavioral Intention.\r\nCorrelation of all continuous variables with behavior and behavioral intention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we focus in on the correlations between all continuous variables and Behavioral Intention as well as Behavior and the different types of Behavior.\r\nApart from the correlations already discussed, it becomes apparent that correlations differ between the different types of Behavior.\r\nCOVID-19 Behavioral Intention and COVID-19 Behavior are both weakly correlated with Climate Crisis Behavioral Intention and Climate Crisis Behavior.\r\nNone of the Big Five variables show a substantial (\\(\\rho > 0.3\\)) significant correlation with any type of Behavior or Behavioral Intention, nor do Internal or External Control Conviction\r\nFurther, there are no perceptible correlations for age, the household size, or the number of children living in the household.\r\nKruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for categorical variables\r\nAs the data for Behavior is non-parametric, we use the Kruskal Wallis test, the Pairwise Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to detect group differences.\r\nGender\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a significant difference between male and female respondents, but the difference in median and mean values is insubstantial.\r\nEducation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no significant difference in Behavior for different education levels.\r\nOccupation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are significant difference for behavior according to occupation.\r\nTo further investigate these, a pairwise Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test could only be calculated when excluding the observations for student (school) and in vocational training.\r\nUniversity students report significantly stronger climate protective behavior than respondents who are employed full-time, part-time or report to be not in paid employment.\r\nIncome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a barely significant difference between some income groups.\r\nDietary Habits (including diet behavior)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a significant difference in climate protective behavior according to the dietary habits respondents report.\r\nAs the overall ‘Behavior’ variable also includes a measure of avoiding animal products, this is to be expected.\r\nDietary Habits and Diet Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a strong relationship between the reported diet behavior and the reported diet style.\r\nDietary Habits and Heating Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the difference persists, albeit weaker, when considering differences in climate protective heating behavior (i.e., concsiously heating less).\r\nFor example, Respondents who report to eat meat every day report significantly less such climate protective behavior than all other groups.\r\nDietary Habits and Driving Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA similar significant trend can be observed when it comes to driving, or the avoidance thereof to protect the climate.\r\nRespondents who report to eat animal products often seem to be significantly less likely to avoid driving.\r\nDietary Habits and General Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDietary Habits (excluding diet behavior)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar differences can be observed in general climate protective behavior.\r\nCar Ownership\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a significant differences in Behavior between respondents who own a car and respondents who don’t.\r\nAgain, one of the behavior questions asks for avoiding driving by car, so this is not too surprising.\r\nCar Ownership (excluding Driving Behavior)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis difference vanishes when excluding Driving Behavior.\r\nDistance Driven for Business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some significant difference in behavior according to the reported differences driven for business in the last year.\r\nNo clear pattern emerges, though.\r\nDistance Driven Privately\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondents that report they have not driven by car in the last year at all also report overall higher climate protective behavior.\r\nAs with dietary climate protective behavior, this is to be expected as the overall climate protective behavior includes driving.\r\nDistance Driven Privately and Driving Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople who report to have not driven at all show significantly higher behavior than all other groups.\r\nOther than that, most other groups are rather similar.\r\nDistance Driven Privately and Diet Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, there is no significant difference when it comes to reported diet behavior.\r\nDistance Driven Privately and Heating Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither is there for heating behavior.\r\nDistance Driven Privately and General Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no difference for general behavior, either.\r\nDistance Driven Privately (excluding Driving Behavior)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNor is there a difference when excluding driving behavior.\r\nKnowledge\r\nIn this section, we examine the relationship between specific questions and Behavior as well as Subjective Knowledge.\r\nToday’s global CO2 concentration in the atmosphere already occurred in the past 650,000 years. Correct answer: False.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondents who answer this question correctly show show significantly more behavior than those who do not, though the differences is marginal.\r\nSimilarly, there are significant though marginal differences in Subjective Knowledge.\r\nDespite its very low concentration in the atmosphere, nitrous oxide contributes about 6 % to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, as its effect as a greenhouse gas is 298 times stronger than that of CO2. Correct answer: True.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this question, there are only significant though marginal differences between Subjective Knowledge.\r\nCO2 usually remains in the atmosphere for between 10 and 20 years. Correct answer: False.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same is true for this question.\r\nThe Earth has been in a phase of rewarming from the Little Ice Age since about 1850, which is roughly the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Correct answer: True.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, there are only significant though marginal differences between Subjective Knowledge.\r\nThe ozone hole is one of the major causes of global warming. Correct answer: False.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are marginal significant differences in both Behavior and Subjective Knowledge.\r\nLarge volcanic eruptions significantly amplify global warming. Correct answer: False.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs before, there are significant though marginal differences in Subjective Knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
